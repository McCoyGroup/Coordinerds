!!      Charge and Spin Line:
!!          The first line of the molecule specification section specifies the
!!        net electric charge (a signed integer) and the spin multiplicity
!!        (usually a positive integer).
!!          Thus, for a neutral molecule in a singlet state, the entry 0 1 is
!!        appropriate.
!!        For a radical anion, -1 2 would be used.
!!        Multiple charge/spin pairs may/must be included for some calculation types.
!!        Doesn't strictly need a comment but it's not a bad idea
!
! Example:
0 1 ! no charge, no spin state
